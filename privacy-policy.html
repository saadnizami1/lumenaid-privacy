    <h1>Privacy Policy for LumenAid</h1>

    <div class="header-info">
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 14, 2026</p>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 14, 2026</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>LumenAid ("Look Around") is an accessibility application designed to help visually impaired users identify objects around them using AI-powered object detection and voice commands. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>LumenAid does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal information.</strong>
    </div>

    <h3>Camera Access</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> The app requires camera access to capture real-time video frames for object detection.</li>
        <li><strong>Processing:</strong> All camera data is processed locally on your device using on-device AI models.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Camera frames are NOT saved, recorded, or stored in any form. They are processed in real-time and immediately discarded.</li>
        <li><strong>Transmission:</strong> Camera data is NEVER transmitted over the internet or to any servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Microphone Access</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> The app requires microphone access for voice command recognition (e.g., "analysis", "detect").</li>
        <li><strong>Processing:</strong> Voice input is processed using Android's built-in speech recognition on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> Audio is NOT recorded or stored. Voice commands are processed in real-time and immediately discarded.</li>
        <li><strong>Transmission:</strong> Audio data is NEVER transmitted over the internet or to any servers (except to Android's speech recognition service, which is handled by Google as per their privacy policy).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>AI Model Processing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Method:</strong> Object detection is performed using TensorFlow Lite models (YOLOv8) that run entirely on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Data:</strong> No data from the AI processing is sent to external servers or stored on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data We Do NOT Collect</h2>
    <p>LumenAid does NOT collect, store, or have access to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Personal identification information</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>Usage analytics or statistics</li>
        <li>Device information beyond what's needed for the app to function</li>
        <li>Any other personal or sensitive data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>LumenAid does NOT use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase Analytics)</li>
        <li>Advertising networks</li>
        <li>Third-party data collection tools</li>
        <li>Cloud services for data storage or processing</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The only third-party service the app may interact with is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Android Speech Recognition:</strong> When you use voice commands, Android's built-in speech recognition service (operated by Google) processes your voice input according to Google's Privacy Policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>LumenAid retains NO data.</strong>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Camera frames are processed in memory and immediately discarded.</li>
        <li>Voice commands are processed and immediately discarded.</li>
        <li>No logs, files, or databases are created to store user data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p><strong>LumenAid does NOT share any data</strong> because we don't collect any data.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>LumenAid does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. The app is designed for users who need accessibility features and does not target children specifically.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Since LumenAid does not collect or store any user data, there is no user data to secure. All processing happens locally on your device, and no data leaves your device.</p>

    <h2>Permissions Explained</h2>
    <p>The app requests the following permissions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Camera</strong> (<code>android.permission.CAMERA</code>): Required to capture real-time video for object detection.</li>
        <li><strong>Microphone</strong> (<code>android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO</code>): Required to recognize voice commands for hands-free operation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Both permissions are essential for the app's core functionality. You can revoke these permissions at any time through your device's Settings &gt; Apps &gt; LumenAid &gt; Permissions.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with a new "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we don't collect any personal data, there is no data to access, modify, or delete. The app operates entirely offline with real-time processing.</p>
